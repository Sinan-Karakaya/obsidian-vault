# Example of a supervised learning

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Label |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----- |
| 6 | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 14 | 0 |
| 2 | 3 | 5 | 1 |

A dataset is composed of 2 groups: **features** and **labels**. The set of features would be called a **feature matrix**, a row of features would be called a **feature vector,** and the label for that row would be the **target for that feature vector**. 

## In short, the training

Features are considered the inputs of our model, they will be computed in some form and give an output.

Labels are in comparison the output of our model you could say. In binary models, they are either 0 or 1, whereas in multi class models, this would be different.

In a supervised learning, labels are already given to the models for its training. This way, we, and the model, know what result to expect. This will help automatically validate the guess of the model during its training.
