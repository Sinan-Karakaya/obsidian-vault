In our case here, we want to divide the different labels in group. In our case it would be represented as a line since it only has 2 features, but it would become a plane in 3D if we had more features.

Which of these lines would be the best separator for our case ? Obviously, it is A, since it delimits the best the 2 groups. But what about this case ?

Well, it would still be A. Since B and C are so close to some already existing points, it would make the accuracy worst.
